# naijR <img src="man/figures/edo-sticker-with-border.png" width=100px align="right" />

naijR is an R package that contains a suite of functions that make it easier to deal with data and datasets about the country Nigeria and its constituent parts.

Inspiration for the project is drawn from experience within real data science projects wherein peculiar problems were encountered. Some of these include:

- Data cleaning: When dealing with data specific to the county, there are data entry issues that seem to occur quite frequently. Rather applying repetitious data cleaning tasks, it is better to encapsulate them in a way to automate them.
- Data point ambiguity: Although key data are standardized by relevant authorities e.g. names of administrative divisions like Local Government Areas, it is still common to find bodies of data where these points are used arbitrarily and incorrectly.
- Dependence on proprietary tools: Many organisations in Nigeria defer to the use of tools that add their own layer of complexity to data management without due cognisance being taken of the peculiarities associated with local data sets.

naijR brings an approach to data analysis that is tailored towards enhance the productivity of anyone working with any data that has to do with Nigeria.
