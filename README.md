# naijR
R package on Nigeria and for Nigeria

## Status
Development of this package is currently ongoing. Though I am the lead protagonist, there are other hands working on this project. Once we are satisfied with the work we've done so far (which will be soon), we will throw it open to researchers and data scientists, especially our "Naija pipul dem".

## The Goal
Our purpose is bring out some of the country-specific peculiarities that will make analysis of data related to Nigeria much easier for R users.

## An Appeal
Visitors to this repository are welcome to suggest what kind of features they would like included in such a package.

Thanks
